# Perceptron_LogisticReg
Build your own Perceptron and LogReg (MNIST Data)

Perceptron is bult with sigmoid activation and Gradient descent weight update (Perceptron Loss Function)


Logistic Regression is bult with sigmoid activation and Gradient descent weight update (Cross Entropy Loss Function)

Bias Term is added in X not written under Classes

Main difference between Perceptron and LR is the Gradient Descent weight update.
